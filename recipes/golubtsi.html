        <p>Cabbage leaves stuffed with a savoury combination of ground beef, pork, rice and vegetables, then cooked in the oven in a creamy tomato sauce. Making cabbage rolls at home is much easier than you think! </p>
        <p>Stuffed Cabbage rolls is a dish that every Russian and Ukrainian family makes. It’s a true comfort food for us, while managing to be quite healthy! It might be a little fiddly but not difficult at all.</p>
        <p>Ingredients</p>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cabbage</li>
            <li>1/2 cup rice, any type</li>
            <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>1 onion</li>
            <li>1 lbs ground beef</li>
            <li>1 lbs ground port </li>
            <li>1/4 cup parsley</li>
            <li>2 carrots</li>
            <li>2 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1 tsp pepper</li>
            <li>2-3 bay leaf</li> 
        </ul>
        <p>Steps</p>
        <ol>
           <li>Freeze the cabbages 3 days before you need it. The night before defrost cabbage and keep them in the fridge until you are ready.</li> 
           <li>Cook rice in plenty water the same way you would pasta until al dente for approximately 5 minutes after the water boils. It shouldn't be too soft. Drain and set aside. </li>
           <li>In a frying pan heat olive oil and cook onions over low heat for 7-10 minutes until tender.</li>
           <li>Grate carrots. In a large bowl combine beef, pork, parsley, onions, carrots, rice, salt and pepper.</li>
           <li>In a medium bowl whisk together stock, crushed tomatoes and creme fraiche, salt and pepper. Set aside.</li>
           <li>Place your head of cabbage on a cutting board, cut off the bottom and pull the leaves away from the stalk. Repeat with the second head of cabbage.</li>
           <li>Preheat your oven to 350F/180C.</li>
           <li>Clear your work space, so all ingredients are within reach. Take a cabbage leaf and cut the rib down, so it's not too thick. Put 2 tbsp of filling at the bottom of the wide part of a leaf (see picture above) and roll it like a burrito, tucking sides in. Your cabbage rolls will vary in size slightly depending on the size of cabbage leaves. You will have approximately 30-32 cabbage rolls.</li>
           <li>Pour a cup of the sauce on the bottom of your cast iron casserole or any other heavy bottom casserole and start stacking your cabbage rolls. Half way through add a couple of bay leaves and ⅓ of the sauce and continue stacking until all cabbage rolls are gone.</li>
           <li>Pour the remaining sauce over cabbage rolls, cover with a lid and bake in the oven for 1 hour. Then take the lid off and bake for 30 more minutes. Serve with additional sour cream or creme fraiche and fresh herbs like dill and parsley.
