        <p>Vareniki or varenyky is a staple dish in Russian and Ukrainian cuisines. They are half-moon shaped dumplings that are boiled in salted water.</p>
        <p>Vareniki fillings may vary, but the most common version is the potato version. Depending on the filling, they can be served as a starter or as a dessert. It is customary to accompany varenieki with Russian sour cream called smetana</p>
